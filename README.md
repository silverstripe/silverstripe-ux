Open Source Design Work for the SilverStripe CMS

The intention of these files are to allow more visibility of the designs planned for development, as well as experimental designs used for prototype testing.

These are working documents and will be continuously improved over time. As the pattern library expands this file will become more complete and easier to extract component styles.

## Working with the files:
To use these files, link the symbols file (Symbols.sketch) to the rest of the files (https://sketchtalk.io/discussion/2719/libraries-beta-native-in-sketch) to work as a shared symbol file.
You can work straight from the symbols file for your own designs (for ease of use) as long as you are not merging these files back into the master repository.
These design files require Sketch plugins to work, otherwise they will most likely appear broken.

Note:
These files will be updated on an approx. monthly bases

### Required plugins:
* Sketch bounding boxer - hiding and showing padding and margins within sketch, by default they are hidden so they might not bother you
* Anima Launchpad - more control over positioning of items incl. negative placements
* Paddy - automated padding, spacing and alignment for your Sketch layers

### Plugins required for OS contribution—typically for SilverStripe designers (available on request to community):
* Abstract - Merge tool for multiple people working on the same sketch files at the same time
* Symbol organizer - Organisation of the symbols pages to keep it orderly and manageable
* Symbol and art board organizer - Used for art board organisation
* Craft - Handy for adding design/mockups to the SilverStripe OS InVision project (to link to GitHub issue)
* Symbol swapper – ckeep you symbols in order by replacing older symbols with the newer ones, great for moving symbols between sketch files
* Colour contrast checker – designers should ensure design have sufficient contrast to meet WCAG standards

### Output of designs
* Design Manager System – the output of our colours, typography and style guide can be seen publicly on SilverStripe DSM - If you have the plugin installed you can access these global styles to use in your designs (https://projects.invisionapp.com/dsm/silver-stripe/silver-stripe)
* For development purposes we use InVision to share and comment on designs

### Feedback welcome
