Open Source Design Work for the SilverStripe CMS

## Working with the files:
You should link the file "CMS Symdols.sketch" to your own sketch design file unless you work straight from the symbols file.
These disign files require Sketch plugins to work (otherwise they will appear broken).

## Required plugins:
* Sketch bounding boxer - hiding and showing padding and margins within sketch
* Lauchpad - more control over positioning of items incl. negative placements

## For OS contribution (potentially available on request):
* Abstract - Merge tool for multiple people working on the same sketch files at the same time
* Brand.ai - We store all of our base colours here and they can be transfered across multiple sketch files
* Symbol organizer - Organisation of the symbols pages to keep it orderly and managable
* Symbol and artboard organizer - Used for artboard organisation
* Craft - Handy for adding design/mockups to the SilverStripe OS invision project (to link to github issue)
