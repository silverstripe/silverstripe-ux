Open Source Design Work for the SilverStripe CMS

The intention of these files is to allow more visibility of the designs planned for development, as well as experiemental designs used for prototype testing.

These are working documents so they are not meant to be pretty, although as the pattern library expands this file will become more complete and easier to extract component styles.

## Working with the files:
To see these files in action please link the symbols file (CMS Symdols.sketch) to the rest of the files (https://sketchtalk.io/discussion/2719/libraries-beta-native-in-sketch)
You could work straight from the symbols file to make use of the symbols for ease of use as long as you are not merging these files back into the master repository.
These disign files require Sketch plugins to work—otherwise they will most likely appear broken.

Note: 
* The information (Master @ 951921b)on file names are only required for using the design merging tool Abstract and not required to use the files so they can be renamed if desired.
* These files will be updated on an approx. monthly bases

### Required plugins:
* Sketch bounding boxer - hiding and showing padding and margins within sketch
* Lauchpad - more control over positioning of items incl. negative placements

### Plugins required for OS contribution—typically for SilverStripe designers (available on request to community):
* Abstract - Merge tool for multiple people working on the same sketch files at the same time
* Brand.ai - We store all of our base colours here and they can be transfered across multiple sketch files
* Symbol organizer - Organisation of the symbols pages to keep it orderly and managable
* Symbol and artboard organizer - Used for artboard organisation
* Craft - Handy for adding design/mockups to the SilverStripe OS invision project (to link to github issue)
