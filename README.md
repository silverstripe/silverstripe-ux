Open Source Design Work for the SilverStripe CMS

The intention of these files is to allow more visibility of the designs planned for development, as well as experimental designs used for prototype testing.

These are working documents and will be continuously improved over time, although as the pattern library expands this file will become more complete and easier to extract component styles.

## Working with the files:
To see these files in action please link the symbols file (CMS Symbols.sketch) to the rest of the files (https://sketchtalk.io/discussion/2719/libraries-beta-native-in-sketch).
You can work straight from the symbols file for ease of use as long as you are not merging these files back into the master repository.
These design files require Sketch plugins to work—otherwise they will most likely appear broken.

Note: 
These files will be updated on an approx. monthly bases

### Required plugins:
* Sketch bounding boxer - hiding and showing padding and margins within sketch
* Launchpad - more control over positioning of items incl. negative placements

### Plugins required for OS contribution—typically for SilverStripe designers (available on request to community):
* Abstract - Merge tool for multiple people working on the same sketch files at the same time
* Brand.ai - We store all of our base colours here and they can be transferred across multiple sketch files
* Symbol organizer - Organisation of the symbols pages to keep it orderly and manageable
* Symbol and art board organizer - Used for art board organisation
* Craft - Handy for adding design/mockups to the SilverStripe OS Invision project (to link to GitHub issue) 

## Feedback welcome
