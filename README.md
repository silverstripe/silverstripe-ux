# silverstripe-ux
A space to share open source design work for SilverStripe CMS.

This area intended to provide more visibility of the designs planned for development, as well as experimental designs used for prototype testing. As of Dec 2021 design files have been removed as they are no longer suitable to be shared publically (outdated, could communicate the wrong direction). A better reference of CMS designs would be to visit https://projects.invisionapp.com/dsm/silver-stripe/silverstripe-cms.
